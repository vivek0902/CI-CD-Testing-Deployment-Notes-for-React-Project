## 📘 README: CI/CD + Testing + Deployment Notes for React Project

### 📌 Overview

This project uses a modern development workflow with:
- React (Vite)
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for deployment
- Docker (optional) for containerization and environment consistency

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. 🔧 Create React App with Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

#### 2. 🧪 Add Vitest Testing Setup

Install required packages:

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
```

Update `vite.config.js`:

```js
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/setupTests.js',
  },
})
```

Create `src/setupTests.js`:

```js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
```

Add script in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run"
}
```

Create test file: `App.test.jsx`

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

test('renders hello text', () => {
  render(<App />)
  expect(screen.getByText(/hello/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

---

#### 3. 🚀 Deploy to Vercel

- Push code to GitHub
- Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Import GitHub repo
- Follow prompts (auto-detects Vite config)
- Your app is deployed!

---

#### 4. 🤖 Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI for React + Vitest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
```

---

### ✅ Why Use CI/CD + Testing?

- A small change in one component can break the whole app
- CI/CD:
  - Ensures consistency
  - Catches bugs early
  - Automates testing and deployment
- Testing helps maintain code quality and confidence

---

### 🐳 Docker Integration (Optional)

Create `Dockerfile` for frontend/backend and `docker-compose.yml` to run both containers.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./client
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  backend:
    build: ./server
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

Use Docker in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Build and Run Docker Containers
  run: docker-compose up --build -d
- name: Run Tests Inside Docker
  run: docker exec frontend-container-name npm test
```

---

### 📈 Final Workflow Summary

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| Push to GitHub | GitHub Actions runs Vitest tests |
| Tests Pass ✅ | App is deployed to Vercel |
| Tests Fail ❌ | No deploy, you get alerts |
| Add new features | Write or update tests |
| Use Docker | For consistent environments |

If you want this saved directly in your GitHub repo, create a file called `README.md` and paste this content inside.

Let me know if you'd like a version with your **project name**, **live demo link**, or **badge integration** (e.g., Vercel deploy status or test badge)!
